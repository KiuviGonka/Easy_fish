# Easy_fish
| Bot fish for tera |


Hello, anyone interested in this type of mod?...
I am selling one for a very low price, totally safe.
It has a small bug and it is that sometimes it does not stop fishing and fishing... so if you want to do something else you would have to restart the proxy.

I give this mod for free to whoever helps me solve that bug xD !!

Characteristics and use:
* Fishing automatically. (30-40s)
* Dismantle fish when inventory is full.
* Craft baits if you don't have them in your inventory.

*I can enable you to sell them to a market instead of dismantling them, but at your own risk... I don't know how safe that option is.
